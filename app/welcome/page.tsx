                This is an attempt at a handmade project. It's one that I've put
                a fair amount of work into so I hope that you like it.

                Nothing on the next pages will make up for being so late with
                this, I know that. I will always feel guilt about being so
                belated in giving you this.

                ever forgot about this.
